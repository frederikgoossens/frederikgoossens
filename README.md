### 🔧 What I'm Working On

Currently focused on public tools at the intersection of:

- 🖥️ Real-time dashboards (Elixir + LiveView)
- ⚙️ Cross-platform CLI utilities (Vlang)
- 🔐 Privacy and self-sovereign data protection
- 🔗 Smart contracts and tokenisation (Solidity, Ethereum)
- 🧾 **Blockchain-based proof of innovation** — a faster, decentralised alternative to traditional patent filing

Most of my previous work was confidential or advisory. I am now releasing open-source tools combining decentralised infrastructure, verifiable trust, and user privacy.

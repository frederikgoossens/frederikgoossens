### 🔒 **Note on GitHub Activity:**

**Now expanding into public blockchain development** with my AI Act Compliance and Provenance Registry - the first of many open-source contributions bridging AI strategy with Web3 implementation.

I will soon enable visibility for private repository contributions, reflecting ongoing activity frequency.

### 🛠️ Why My Profile Is (Currently) Sparse

- From 2012 to 2025, I primarily used Bitbucket and GitLab before fully switching to GitHub.
- As a result, I am currently rebuilding my portfolio here from scratch.
- If you’d like more information about a specific project or need validation, please contact me.

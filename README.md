### 🔧 What I'm Working On

I’m currently focused on building public tools at the intersection of:

- 🧠 Privacy & Compliance
- 🖥️ Real-Time Dashboards (Elixir + LiveView)
- ⚙️ Cross-Platform CLI Tools (Vlang)
- 🔗 Smart Contracts & Tokenisation (Solidity, Ethereum)

Most of my past work was private or strategic. I’m now releasing open-source projects that combine decentralised infrastructure, user privacy, and verifiable trust systems.

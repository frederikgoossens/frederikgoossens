# Frederik Goossens 👋

### AI Strategist • Blockchain Developer • Web3 Compliance Architect | Cambridge EMBA

**Founder @ [Merlaz](https://merlaz.com) — Building the future of AI accountability, provenance, and compliance on-chain.**

I help organisations harness the full potential of Generative AI, blockchain, and regulatory technology. My mission is to create **trust-first, decentralised systems** that align with evolving standards like the **EU AI Act** while defending against content misuse and model exploitation.

### 🛠️ Now Building in Public:

I'm now publishing my work at the intersection of:
- 🧠 Generative AI Strategy & Automation
- 🔗 Blockchain + Smart Contracts (Solidity, zk-SNARKs, EVM)
- 🔍 AI Compliance & EU Regulatory Tooling
- 🧾 Content Provenance & Copyright Protection
- 🔒 Privacy-first Infrastructure (Elixir, Vlang, WASM, eBPF)

> Most early work at **Merlaz** was private or advisory. I’m now focusing on **public, open-source tools** and decentralised governance frameworks.

### 🌍 Featured Project — **AI Accountability Ecosystem**

A modular system for AI compliance & provenance:
1. 🧾 **Registry** – EU AI Act–compliant smart contract registry  
2. 🧬 **Provenance** – Watermark & detect AI-generated content  
3. ⚖️ **Guidance** – Tools for transparent & ethical AI adoption

Built with Solidity, verified on-chain. Inspired by EU policy, privacy movements, and decentralised governance.

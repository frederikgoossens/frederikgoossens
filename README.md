### 🔧 What I'm Working On

I’m currently focused on building public tools at the intersection of:

- 🖥️ Real-Time Dashboards (Elixir + LiveView)
- ⚙️ Cross-Platform CLI Tools (Vlang)
- 🔐 Privacy & Self-Sovereign Data Protection
- 🔗 Smart Contracts & Tokenisation (Solidity, Ethereum)
- 🧾 **Blockchain-based Proof of Innovation** — a faster, decentralised alternative to traditional patent filing

Most of my earlier work was confidential or advisory. I'm now releasing open-source tools combining decentralised infrastructure, verifiable trust systems, and user privacy.

# Frederik Goossens 👋

### Generative AI Strategy Consultant | ChatGPT Solutions & Prompt Engineering | Cambridge EMBA  
**Founder @ [Merlaz](https://merlaz.com)**

I help organisations strategically leverage Generative AI—specialising in ChatGPT-driven solutions, prompt engineering, and AI-powered workflows. Most of my current work at **Merlaz** remains confidential and in stealth mode due to strategic considerations.

### 🚀 **Current Areas of Expertise (Merlaz, Stealth Mode):**
- **Strategic Generative AI & Automation Consulting**
- **ChatGPT Custom Solutions & Advanced Prompt Engineering**
- **AI-driven Workflow Optimisation**

### 🔒 **Note on GitHub Activity:**
Historically, my GitHub profile has shown limited visible activity due to strategic advisory roles and confidential client projects, typically not resulting in publicly visible code contributions.

I will soon enable visibility for private repository contributions on my GitHub profile, reflecting ongoing activity frequency (without disclosing specific project details).
